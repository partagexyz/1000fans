## Private Fans Clubs on the NEAR Blockchain
1000fans is a token-gated content platform for artists, creators, producers, music labels and distributors to connect with their 1000 most dedicated fans. This platform provides fans with exclusive content, music and video players, link to private events and a private chat for fans and their favorite artist. All secured by crypto tokens technology.

### Repository description:
This repository contains:
- a smart contract, written in rust, generated by "cargo near new contract" and stored in the /contract subfolder of the root folder 1000fans. 
- a frontend, written in javascript, generated by "npx create-near-app@latest" and stored in the /frontend subfolder of the root folder 1000fans. a demo of the frontend interface is publicly accessible at https://theosis.1000fans.xyz
- backend scripts, written in python, called metadata_extractor.py, upload.py, and chatHistory.py, and stored in the /scripts subfolder of the root folder 1000fans.
- an AWS s3 bucket, to store the shared content such as music, videos and other metadata files. In particular it contains audioMetadata.json, chatHistory.json, eventsMetadata.json, videoMetadata.json, nocoverfound.jpg (a default cover image when no album cover is found in the audio files' metadata), and the /music and /videos folders to store the audio and video files.

An automation is setup to scan for updates in the local folders /music and /videos once every 24 hours and update the AWS storage. 

### Technology Stack:
- **Blockchain**: NEAR Blockchain
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with the latest Next.js framework
- **Smart Contract**: A fan-token minter contract, limited to 1000 units.

#### Frontend Features:
- **Homepage**: Contains cards to trigger widgets displaying the gated content.
- **Navigation Bar**: User authentication and link to web3 interaction console.
- **Footer**: Credits and dark/light toggle.

#### Smart Contract Features: 
A smart contract to mint, transfer and check ownership of 1000 fans tokens (from fan000 to fan999). Any near wallet owner can buy tokens. Any token holder can offer their token for sale.

### Membership Verification Process:
Upon wallet connection, the platform checks for the presence of the valid membership token:
- **Valid Token**: Unlocks content.
- **Invalid Token**: Redirects to a membership purchase page.

### Gated Content Description:
- **Music Catalog**: Styled like a Spotify playlist, displaying tracks with artist names, song titles, and icons.
- **Video Catalog**: Mimics a YouTube channel interface with video previews, sortable by various filters for user convenience.
- **Event Catalog**: Features a calendar view and a carousel of upcoming events. Clicking an event card leads to a ticket purchase.
- **Chat Room**: Private p2p discussions between token holders and the content creator.

### Roadmap:
- ~~Build the frontend with Javascript, HTML and CSS.~~
- ~~Write the smart contract with Rust.~~
- ~~Deploy and test the smart contract on testnet.~~
- ~~Implement a "token check" in the wallet login.~~
- ~~Implement a shop to allow the mint and transfer of fans token. (route users based on wallet connect? and token ownership? action buttons and input fields on the shop UI.~~)
- ~~Update the smart contract: max 1 token per account, token count to automatically set the token ID: fan000, fan001, ..., fan999.~~ 
- ~~Redeploy the contract on a new account 1000fans.testnet. start from scratch with token fan000. re-test all access-keys etc.~~
- ~~Improve platform's design.~~
- ~~Add a private chat for fans.~~ ~~fix the chat history saving~~. 
- fetch eventsMetadata from resident advisor API? track events by organizer Theosis Records.
- Smart-contract update:  ~~Allow multiple token holding~~. ~~Remove 1-year-holding-before-sale rule~~. Add a paiement system for token sale. Anyone can sell their tokens from their dashboard. add function listTokensForSale. Batch mint/transfer tokens. 
- Shop update: (call it commands or dashboard): no mint function for public: check ownership and "join the waitlist or check tokens for sale" or "offer your token for sale". display the text lower on the page to match background.
- Test the platform with a closed group of users on testnet.
- Update the platform on user feedback.
- Deploy the contract on mainnet.
- Automate cloning from main domain 1000fans.xyz
