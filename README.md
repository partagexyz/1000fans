## Exclusive Fans Clubs on the NEAR Blockchain
1000fans is a token-gated content platform for artists, creators, producers, music labels and distributors to connect with their 1000 most dedicated fans. This platform provides fans with exclusive content, a music and video player, link to private events and a closed chat for fans and their favorite artist. All secured by crypto tokens technology.

The app is made of:
- a smart contract, written in rust, generated by "cargo near new contract" and stored in the /contract subfolder of the root folder 1000fans. 
- a frontend, written in javascript, generated by "npx create-near-app@latest" and stored in the /frontend subfolder of the root folder 1000fans. a demo of the frontend interface is publicly accessible at https://theosis.1000fans.xyz
- backend scripts, written in python, called metadata_extractor.py, upload.py, and chatHistory.py, and stored in the /scripts subfolder of the root folder 1000fans.
- an AWS s3 bucket, to store the shared content such as music, videos and other metadata files. In particular it contains audioMetadata.json, chatHistory.json, eventsMetadata.json, videoMetadata.json, nocoverfound.jpg (a default cover image when no album cover is found in the audio files' metadata), and the /music and /videos folders to store the audio and video files.

An automation is setup to scan for updates in the local folders /music and /videos once every 24 hours and update the AWS storage. 

#### Technology Stack:
- **Blockchain**: NEAR Blockchain
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with the latest Next.js framework
- **Smart Contract**: An NFT minter contract, limited to 1000 fans tokens.

#### Smart Contract Features: 
A smart contract to mint, transfer and check ownership of 1000 fans tokens (from fan000 to fan999). Any token holder can offer their token for sale. Any near wallet owner can buy tokens.

#### Frontend Features:
- **Homepage**: Designed to engage and excite potential members with details about exclusive perks and artist insights.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a prominent wallet connect/disconnect button for user authentication.
- **Footer**: Links to the artist's social media platforms for broader community engagement.

#### Membership Verification:
Upon wallet connection, the platform checks for the presence of the valid membership token:
- **Valid Token**: Unlocks content.
- **Invalid Token**: Redirects to a membership purchase page.

#### Content Access:
- **Music Catalog**: Styled like a Spotify playlist, displaying tracks with artist names, song titles, and icons.
- **Video Catalog**: Mimics a YouTube channel interface with video previews, sortable by various filters for user convenience.
- **Event Catalog**: Features a calendar view and a carousel of upcoming events. Clicking an event card leads to a ticket purchase.

#### Development Goals:
- **Security**: Ensuring that all transactions and content access are secure and only accessible to token holders.
- **User Experience**: A Netflix-like UI/UX to ensure ease of navigation and enjoyment of premium content.
- **Scalability**: Preparing the platform for potential expansion while maintaining performance and security.

#### Next Steps:
- ~~Build the frontend with Javascript, HTML and CSS.~~
- ~~Write the smart contract with Rust.~~
- ~~Deploy and test the smart contract on testnet.~~
- ~~Implement a "token check" in the wallet login.~~
- ~~Implement a shop to allow the mint and transfer of fans token. (route users based on wallet connect? and token ownership? action buttons and input fields on the shop UI.~~)
- ~~Update the smart contract: max 1 token per account, token count to automatically set the token ID: fan000, fan001, ..., fan999.~~ 
- ~~Redeploy the contract on a new account 1000fans.testnet. start from scratch with token fan000. re-test all access-keys etc.~~
- ~~Improve platform's design.~~
- ~~Add a private chat for fans.~~ fix the chat history saving. 
- fetch eventsMetadata from resident advisor API? track events by organizer Theosis Records.
- Smart-contract update:  ~~Allow multiple token holding~~. ~~Remove 1-year-holding-before-sale rule~~. Add a paiement system for token sale. Anyone can transfer their tokens. Batch transfering tokens. 1000 tokens minted at smart contract init (500 to shareholders, 500 to fans). 
- Shop update: (call it commands or dashboard?): no need for a mint function. check ownership and display "join the waitlist or check tokens for sale" or "offer your token for sale". display the text lower on the page to match background. token transfer: through email or named account?
- Test the platform with a closed group of users on testnet.
- Update the platform's design and UI/UX on user feedback.
- Create a series of 1000 images for 1000 fans tokens.
- Deploy the smart contract on mainnet + the platform at 1000fans.xyz.
