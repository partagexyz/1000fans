## Exclusive Fan Club Platform on NEAR Blockchain
We are developing a premium, token-gated platform for an artist to connect with their 1000 most dedicated fans. This platform will offer exclusive music, video content, and access to private events, all secured by blockchain technology.

#### Technology Stack:
- **Blockchain**: NEAR Blockchain
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with the latest Next.js framework
- **Development Start**: Utilize the NEAR boilerplate with npx create-near-app@latest
- **Smart Contract**: An NFT minter contract, limited to 1000 tokens, to be deployed on NEAR's mainnet post-testnet validation.

#### Platform Features:
- **Homepage**: Designed to engage and excite potential members with details about exclusive perks and artist insights.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a prominent wallet connect/disconnect button for user authentication.
- **Sidebar**: Features categories like Music, Videos, and Events, each marked with a lock icon to denote exclusivity until membership is verified.
- **Footer**: Links to the artist's social media platforms for broader community engagement.

#### Membership Verification:
Upon wallet connection, the platform checks for the presence of the valid membership token:
- **Valid Token**: Unlocks content by removing the lock icon from sidebar categories.
- **Invalid Token**: Redirects users to a membership purchase page.

#### Content Access:
- **Music Catalog**: Styled like a Spotify playlist, displaying tracks with artist names, song titles, and icons. Music playback is integrated with an overlay player, similar to Spotify, Mixcloud, or SoundCloud.
- **Video Catalog**: Mimics a YouTube channel interface with video previews, sortable by various filters for user convenience. Clicking a video card directs to a private YouTube page for exclusive viewing.
- **Event Catalog**: Features a calendar view and a carousel of upcoming events. Clicking an event card leads to a private Eventbrite page for ticket purchases.

#### Development Goals:
- **Security**: Ensuring that all transactions and content access are secure and only accessible to token holders.
- **User Experience**: A Netflix-like UI/UX to ensure ease of navigation and enjoyment of premium content.
- **Scalability**: Preparing the platform for potential expansion while maintaining performance and security.

#### Next Steps:
- Build the frontend with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- Write the smart contract with Rust.
- Implement a "token check" in the wallet login.
- Deploy the smart contract on testnet, and test the platform.
- Deploy the smart contract on mainnet, and the platform in production mode on a remote server.
- Beta testing with a closed group of partners before full launch to the 1000 fans.
